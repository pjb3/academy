# Academy

This is a Khan Academy-like web-application built with Rails to allow you to have an online course that is made of up of videos and quizzes that can be taken by students and an instructor can track their progress.

## Install

You need Ruby 2.1.5, bundler and postgres installed to run this. Then it should be as simple as:

```
$ bundle
$ rake db:setup
$ rails s
$ open http://localhost:3000
```
